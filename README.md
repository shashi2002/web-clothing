## Steps to execute:
Install Node.js and npm:

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download and install them from the official website: Node.js Downloads.

Install Angular CLI:

Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally:

>>npm install -g @angular/cli


Create a New Angular Project:

Use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project. Navigate to your project's parent directory in the command prompt or terminal and run the following command (replace my-angular-app with your desired project name):

>>ng new my-angular-app

Navigate to Your Project Directory:

Change into your project directory using the cd command. For example:

>>cd my-angular-app
Serve the Application:

You can now serve your Angular application locally using the development server. Run the following command:

>>ng serve
This will build your project and start a development server. You will see output in the terminal with a URL (usually http://localhost:4200/). Open this URL in your web browser.

View Your Angular Web Page:

Your Angular web page should now be accessible in your web browser. By default, you'll see the Angular welcome page. You can start editing the application by modifying the files in the project directory, particularly the src folder, which contains your application code.

Make Changes and Test:

As you make changes to your application code (e.g., in the components or templates), the development server will automatically detect them and rebuild the application. You can see the changes by simply refreshing your browser.

Stop the Development Server:

To stop the development server, go back to the terminal and press Ctrl + C.
